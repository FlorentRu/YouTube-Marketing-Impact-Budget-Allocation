## Project Overview

In this demo project, we simulate a year’s worth of daily marketing spend across three channels:
1. **Search Ads**  
2. **Display Ads**  
3. **YouTube Ads**

We also generate a daily “outcome” metric (e.g., sign-ups or views). Then we:

- Explore the data and measure how each channel contributes to the outcome.  
- Build a **multiple linear regression** model to estimate each channel’s incremental impact.  
- Use optimization techniques from **SciPy** to allocate a fixed budget across channels in a way that maximizes the predicted outcome.

**Why?**  
Companies like Google and YouTube rely on data scientists to understand how marketing spend translates into business results. This project illustrates those core analytics and modeling steps.

## Key Features

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**  
   - Creates a realistic dataset with daily marketing spend, seasonal patterns, and random noise.

2. **Data Exploration**  
   - Statistical summaries (mean, std, etc.)  
   - Correlation heatmaps

3. **Modeling & Impact Analysis**  
   - Multiple linear regression to estimate channel effects  
   - Interpret coefficients as incremental outcome per $1 spent

4. **Budget Optimization**  
   - Given a fixed budget, uses constraint-based optimization to find the best distribution of spend among channels.

5. **Visualization**  
   - Plots of actual vs. predicted outcomes  
   - Residual distribution
